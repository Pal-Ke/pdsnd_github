### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Python is used to explore and understand US bikeshare data.
The data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, will be analyzed to uncover bike share usage patterns. Bike share system usage between three large cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC) is compared in this project.

### Task
Write code to compute and provide a variety of descriptive statistics concerning:

##### Popular times of travel
    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day

##### Popular stations and trip
    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

##### Trip duration
    total travel time
    average travel time

##### User info
    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth

(please note that info on gender and year of birth are only available for NYC and Chicago)
